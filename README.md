# Startup Growth & Investment - Predicting Valuation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the valuation of startups based on key growth and investment factors. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze various financial and business indicators to estimate a startup's valuation, providing insights into the factors driving business success.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes key startup attributes such as:
- Funding rounds
- Investor details
- Market size
- Revenue growth
- Industry sector
- Other financial indicators

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy & pandas** (Data preprocessing & manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning models)
- **XGBoost** (Advanced predictive modeling)

## 📈 Model Training
The project involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding key patterns in startup valuations.
3. **Model Selection & Training** - Implementing regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. **Evaluation** - Assessing model performance using RMSE, R-squared, and cross-validation.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. Install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
